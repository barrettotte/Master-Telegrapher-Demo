## Description
Master Telegrapher is a simple 3D low poly telegraph operator simulation game that uses only one button,
the spacebar. This is the demo I am entering into a one button button game jam. 
Made with Unity and Blender.
This is one of the only game development projects I have finished.

## One Button Game Jam 2016
The goal was to create a simple game in a week that used only one button. Hosted on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/one-button-to-rule-all-jam)
